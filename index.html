    <h1>Cristal Jenson</h1>

    <p>I'm Cristal and I will be getting my Bachelor's degree in <em>Applied Technology</em> from BYU-I this semester. I'm grateful for the oportunity to <br>
       achieve this life-long goal and be able to become self-sufficient and be a servant of the Lord. So far, my education has allowed me to help other  <br>
        people see technology as a useful tool, instead of an obstacle. I hope that one day I will become completely confident in my skills because of my <br>
        and my knowledge that I am child of <strong>God</strong>.
